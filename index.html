        <p>The Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve a COVID-19 vaccine within the next few days. The American Medical Association is calling for prisoners to be prioritized in initial phases of distribution. </p>

        <p>There are more than 1.3 million people in the U.S. in state and federal prisons, and the COVID-19 mortality rate among prisoners is twice as large as that of the general population, according to the National Commission on COVID-19 and
          Criminal Justice. </p>

        <p>Public health experts are calling on prisoners to be included in the early phases of distribution for the COVID-19 vaccine as they are a vulnerable population even though they are not among the general population. The total number of cases
          among prisoners was 251,720 compared to the national total of 749k, according to the COVID Prison Project. </p>
        <p>
          “If you’re driven by epidemiology in terms of where the likelihood of minimizing harm is most likely and I would argue that from that perspective, incarcerated populations ought to be high on that list,” said Holly Taylor, a bioethicist at
          the National Institutes of Health during a virtual web event hosted by The SEICHE Center.
